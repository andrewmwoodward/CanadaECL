</p>
<p>(k) The following interpretations explain and amplify the terms used in this category and elsewhere in this subchapter:
</p>
<p>(1) USML Category V contains explosives, energetic materials, propellants, and pyrotechnics and specially formulated fuels for aircraft, missile, and naval applications. Explosives are solid, liquid, or gaseous substances or mixtures of substances, which, in their primary, booster, or main charges in warheads, demolition, or other military applications, are required to detonate.
</p>
<p>(2) The resulting product of the combination or conversion of any substance controlled by this category into an item not controlled will no longer be controlled by this category provided the controlled item cannot easily be recovered through dissolution, melting, sieving, etc. As an example, beryllium converted to a near net shape using hot isostatic processes will result in an uncontrolled part. A cured thermoset containing beryllium powder is not controlled unless meeting an explosive or propellant control. The mixture of beryllium powder in a cured thermoset shape is not controlled by this category. The mixture of controlled beryllium powder mixed with a typical propellant binder will remain controlled by this category. The addition of dry silica powder to dry beryllium powder will remain controlled.
</p>
<p>(3) Paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this category does not apply to boron and boron carbide enriched with boron-10 (20% or more of total boron-10 content).
</p>
<p>(4) Theoretical specific impulse (Isp) is calculated using standard conditions (1000 psi chamber pressure expanded to 14.7 psi) and measured in units of pound-force-seconds per pound-mass (lbf-s/lbm) or simplified to seconds (s). Calculations will be based on shifting equilibrium.
</p>
<p>(5) Particle size is the mean particle diameter on a weight basis. Best industrial practices will be used in determining particle size and the controls may not be undermined by addition of larger or smaller sized material to shift the mean diameter.

<p>“Range” is the maximum distance that the specified aircraft system is capable of traveling in the mode of stable flight as measured by the projection of its trajectory over the surface of the Earth. The maximum capability based on the design characteristics of the system, when fully loaded with fuel or propellant, will be taken into consideration in determining range. The range for aircraft systems will be determined independently of any external factors such as operational restrictions, limitations imposed by telemetry, data links, or other external constraints. For aircraft systems, the range will be determined for a one-way distance using the most fuel-efficient flight profile (e.g., cruise speed and altitude), assuming International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard atmosphere with zero wind, but with no fuel reserve.</p>

<p><em>Primary payload</em> is that complement of equipment designed from the outset to accomplish the prime mission function of the spacecraft payload mission set. The primary payload may operate independently from the secondary payload(s). <em>Secondary payload</em> is that complement of equipment designed from the outset to be fully integrated into the spacecraft payload mission set. The secondary payload may operate separately from the primary payload. <em>Hosted payload</em> is a complement of equipment or sensors that uses the available or excess capacity (mass, volume, power, etc.) of a spacecraft to accommodate an additional, independent mission. The hosted payload may share the spacecraft bus support infrastructure. The hosted payload performs an additional, independent mission which does not dictate control or operation of the spacecraft. A hosted payload is not capable of operating as an independent spacecraft. <em>Spacecraft bus</em> (distinct from the spacecraft payload), provides the support infrastructure of the spacecraft (e.g., command and data handling, communications and antenna(s), electrical power, propulsion, thermal control, attitude and orbit control, guidance, navigation and control, structure and truss, life support (for crewed mission)) and location (e.g., attachment, interface) for the spacecraft payload. <em>Spacecraft payload</em> is that complement of equipment attached to the spacecraft bus that performs a particular mission in space (e.g., communications, observation, science).</p>

Such information is not within the scope of information captured within the definition of technology in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E.

<p>“Range” is the maximum distance that the specified rocket system is capable of traveling in the mode of stable flight as measured by the projection of its trajectory over the surface of the Earth. The maximum capability based on the design characteristics of the system, when fully loaded with fuel or propellant, will be taken into consideration in determining range. The range for rocket systems will be determined independently of any external factors such as operational restrictions, limitations imposed by telemetry, data links, or other external constraints. For rocket systems, the range will be determined using the trajectory that maximizes range, assuming International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard atmosphere with zero wind.</p>
