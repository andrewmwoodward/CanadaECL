                  <li>The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.</li>
                  <li>For the purpose of 1-1.A.7.b. the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In non-slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporisation of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.</li>

            <button class="accordion">Table - Deposition Techniques - Technical Note</button>
            <div class="panel accordion-content">
<p>Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:</p><ul class="lst-upr-alph"><li>Chemical
 Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification 
coating process wherein a metal, alloy, "composite", dielectric or 
ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are 
decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the 
deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the 
substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process 
may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, 
or "laser" irradiation.<br><br><strong><i>N.B. 1:</i></strong><i><br>CVD
 includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack 
deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition 
(CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.<br><br><strong>N.B. 2:</strong><br>Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.<br><br><strong>N.B. 3:</strong><br>The
 gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using 
the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process,
 except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the 
powder mixture.</i></li><li>Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour 
Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum 
with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is 
used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the 
condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto 
appropriately positioned substrates.<br>The addition of gases to the 
vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound 
coatings is an ordinary modification of the process.<br>The use of ion 
or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's 
deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of 
monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics 
and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes.<br>Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:<ol type="1"><li> Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;</li><li>
 Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive 
heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a 
controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;</li><li> "Laser" Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave "laser" beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;</li><li>
 Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material 
which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the 
surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of
 arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The
 anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, 
through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non 
line-of-sight deposition;<br><br><strong><i>N.B.:</i></strong><i><br>This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.</i></li><li>
 Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in 
which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be 
deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to 
facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The 
introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the 
process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process 
measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are 
ordinary modifications of the process.</li></ol></li><li>Pack 
Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process
 wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that 
consists of:<ol type="1"><li> The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);</li><li> An activator (normally a halide salt); <strong>and</strong></li><li> An inert powder, most frequently alumina.<br>The
 substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is 
heated to between 1,030 K (757° C) and 1,375 K (1,102° C) for sufficient
 time to deposit the coating.</li></ol></li><li>Plasma Spraying is an 
overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and 
controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them 
and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded 
coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure 
plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.<br><br><strong><i>N.B. 1:</i></strong><i><br>Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.<br><br><strong>N.B. 2:</strong><br>High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20° C) at 0.1 MPa.</i></li><li>Slurry
 Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process
 wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is 
suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, 
dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment 
to obtain the desired coating.</li><li>Sputter Deposition is an overlay 
coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein 
positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface 
of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions
 is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and 
deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.<br><br><strong><i>N.B. 1:</i></strong><i><br>The
 Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition 
which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition
 and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit
 vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials.<br><br><strong>N.B. 2:</strong><br>Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.</i></li><li>Ion
 Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the 
element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential 
gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This 
includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously
 with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.</li></ol>
