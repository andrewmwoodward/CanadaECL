                  <li>The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.</li>
                  <li>For the purpose of 1-1.A.7.b. the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In non-slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporisation of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.</li>
